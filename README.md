# Strange Attractors in Complex Networks
Here, we study the spectral embedding that reveals network patterns and links them to dimensionality. This is the code for the paper [Strange Attractors in Complex Networks](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.L042301).

## Directory structure
- `Correlation-dimension`: Contains the Python code for generating the corresponding embedding and calculating the correlation dimension of the network. Please cite [1] if you use this code.
